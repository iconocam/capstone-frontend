# About The Project:
 Schemas of the Mind/ A Brain Analysis
Made using MERN stack, MongoDB, React, NodeJS
- The understanding of all three states is essential in gaining control of the totality of the self.
- Brain Analysis informational dedicated mainly towards Advocate(INFJ) and INTJ(Architect), expanding upon others as progress is made.

 Project Built with React

- React-Router is our main tool in this app as we use it to render most of what our app contains; all of our components and pages.
*This Page Is Still Undergoing Maintenance*

# Routes Here are the available paths
// http://localhost:5173/home
// http://localhost:5173/you
// http://localhost:5173/mind
// http://localhost:5173/us
// http://localhost:5173/heropage

# WebApp
**Home** is the foundation of the INFJ and INTJ. This webapp is primarily curated towards INXX as we retrieve more data.
- INFJ (1,5% of the population), INTJ (2.1%), ENTJ (1.8%) are statistically the rarest function structures in the world.
- Unorthodox function structure
- Unique to each individual, this is entirely subjective 

**Heropage** embeds the community, I could not help but invest in some sort of community investment as we need social connection, feel free to leave a forever message with your name.
- From our hero, you can enter straight into the mind with the *Enter* button.

**Mind** component embeds information thats extracted directly from the database.
- Core of Life, Operationalizations, The Dispatch
- Encountered API error when attempting POST request so we only have one nugget of gold temmporarily.

**You** is subjective as we are all innately built differently with different paths. 
 - Currently 6 Cards are available that entail one crucial aspect of living.
 - Enforce a revelation within the mind through injection
 - Clarify the meaning of what it is to think about your thoughts

** Us ** illustrates our potential as a human collective. I want to add data showing why a function structure is useful in itself.
- Currently, we have 4 structures and their delegated ability.
- Intended to shed light on what could happen through unification, this also ties into sociology(study of life and social behavior)
- People have abilities?!
- Below that we leave the user with some thoughts to ponder upon.



Please feel free to let it be known any ideas that may have arose on your way out in our community!
